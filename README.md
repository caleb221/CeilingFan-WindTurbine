# CeilingFan-WindTurbine
A Ceiling Fan turned into a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)



# Description
I had come into posession of a trashed ceiling fan, what to do?? <br>
Of course, turn it into a wind turbine!<br>
Here is the result of not having a welder and transforming a solar panel control into a Wind Turbine control.

# 3D Printer Settings
Printer: Creality Ender 3 pro V2
Filament: Duramic PETG
Infill: 50%
Support: 10% everywhere
Temp: 235
Slicer: Cura --> Slow on the first layer
--> PLA Should be just fine for the parts as well, i just had PETG because it was cheaper at the time.

# VAWT STL FILES
The VAWT can be found on Thingiverse at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2284021
# STL / FREECAD FILES
I designed the droid using FreeCAD, which is free and works on all major OS platforms.<br>
You are free to edit / change all designs, but please give a reference to the original!<br>
